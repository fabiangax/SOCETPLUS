# SOCETPLUS

### Prerequisites

Install Java on your computer if it isn't installed.

### Installing

You can't run JAR files without Java installed on your computer. If you don't already have Java installed, go to Java's website at https://www.java.com/en/download/ and click the Free Java Download button below the latest version of Java, then install Java once it downloads.
Then search in git the .jar file and execute it, or you can edit the code and build it in your IDE.
